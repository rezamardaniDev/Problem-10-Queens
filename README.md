`
pip install pygame`

## How to Run
After installing the required libraries, execute the script by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`
python vazir.py`

## Customization
If you wish to customize the script further or try solving a different chess problem with a other board(8*8), feel free to modify the code accordingly. The script is designed to be adaptable for various scenarios.
